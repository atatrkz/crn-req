## üìñ How to Use

### GUI Version (Recommended)

1. **Launch the Application**: Run `ITU-CRN-Monitor.exe` or `python crn_taker_gui.py`

2. **Enter Credentials**: 
   - Username: Your ITU student number
   - Password: Your OBS password

3. **Configure CRNs**:
   - **CRNs to Add**: Enter course codes separated by commas (e.g., `22661, 22662, 22634`)
   - **CRNs to Remove**: Enter CRNs you want to drop (optional)
   - **Check Interval**: Set how often to check (default: 3.5 seconds)

4. **Start Monitoring**:
   - Click "Login" to authenticate
   - Once logged in, click "Start Monitoring"
   - The tool will continuously attempt to register for your specified courses

5. **Monitor Results**: Watch the console output for real-time updates and success notifications

### Command Line Version

1. Edit `crn_taker.py` and update the credentials:
   ```python
   USERNAME = "your_student_number"
   PASSWORD = "your_password"
   ```

2. Modify the CRN list in the `make_crn_request` function:
   ```python
   payload = {
       "ECRN": ["22661", "22662", "22634", "22636"],  # CRNs to add
       "SCRN": []  # CRNs to remove
   }
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python crn_taker.py
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### CRN Format
- Enter CRNs as comma-separated values: `22661, 22662, 22634`
- No spaces around commas (or they will be trimmed automatically)
- CRNs should be 5-digit course registration numbers

### Check Interval
- Minimum recommended: 3.5 seconds
- Lower intervals may trigger rate limiting
- Higher intervals reduce monitoring frequency

### Default CRNs
The tool comes pre-configured with example CRNs. **Remember to change these to your desired courses!**

## üîß Building from Source

To create your own executable:

1. Install PyInstaller:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. Build the executable:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name ITU-CRN-Monitor crn_taker_gui.py
   ```

3. The executable will be created in the `dist` folder

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Use Responsibly**: This tool automates course registration attempts. Use it ethically and in accordance with ITU policies
- **Rate Limiting**: The tool includes built-in delays to avoid overwhelming the server
- **Credentials**: Never share your OBS credentials. The tool stores them temporarily in memory only
- **Network**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection
- **Timing**: Course registration periods have specific time windows - make sure you're using this during the correct registration period

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Login Failed**
- Verify your username and password are correct
- Check if OBS is accessible from your network
- Try logging in manually through the web browser first

**JWT Token Error**
- This usually indicates a login issue
- Try logging out and back in to OBS manually
- Restart the application

**No CRN Results**
- Verify the CRN numbers are correct and current
- Check if the course registration period is active
- Ensure the courses exist in the current semester

**Connection Errors**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify ITU OBS is not under maintenance
- Try again after a few minutes

## ‚ö° Tips for Success

1. **Start Early**: Begin monitoring as soon as course registration opens
2. **Multiple Attempts**: The tool will keep trying until you stop it
3. **Monitor Console**: Watch for success messages and error notifications
4. **Backup Plan**: Have alternative courses ready in case your first choices fill up
5. **Network Stability**: Use a reliable internet connection for best results
